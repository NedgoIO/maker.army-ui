## Maker.Army by Nedgo IO:

A Distributed Cloud-Sourced 3D Printing Network

~The Network~

Potential Makers will create an account and enter the amount of time they have each week for these work orders and would register to be makers in approved printers.

The first printer I will allow will be the Tevo Tarantula. It has a community of over 14,000 makers across the globe.

They would pay to get certified. Having to print gcode files and send them in to get certified in specific filaments, quality, volume, and speeds earning them a 'Maker Badge'.

The makers will earn a flat $/hr based on their certifications.

~The Customers~

The Customer submits a 3d model and when they need the finished parts by. A project manager/engineer will go over the tolerances for the part with the customer to find out the needed quality level. They will also consult with them on the appropriate filament to use for the part to ensure it can withstand their use case.

The algorithm sources makers in a radius large enough to fulfill the order in the time specified. After the payment is confirmed, the work orders are sent to the makers for acceptance of the job. The algorithm will source 10% more makers than necessary to ensure the price estimate is accurate in case of makers potentially not having their posted availability. It will send the makers the gcode file for the print with all the correct settings for their machine to make a quality print, tell them what filiment to use, and give them a shipping label to send the finished parts to the brand ambassador.

After the product is printed, a local brand ambassador will act as final QC and process/consolidate all parts before they reach the customer. Handling any needed part rejections and re-submission of work orders to other makers.

The customer receives their parts when they want them and save a lot of money versus going with conventional injection mold.
